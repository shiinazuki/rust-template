# CLAUDE.md

Project conventions for AI coding agents (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, etc.) and human developers.

This project enforces several **counter-intuitive** rules. Default Rust habits will directly break CI. Read this document before making changes.

>   `just template-lint` checks the template repo itself.
> - Fix problems in the template, never only in a generated project—the next generation loses them.
> - CI jobs and git hooks call `justfile` recipes. Change check logic in the justfile, not in workflows.
> - Liquid tags in TOML / YAML must sit at the end of a comment line so the file stays valid.
> - Adding or renaming a placeholder: update `.config/template-values.toml` as well (the smoke test's
>   in-place regeneration check fails otherwise).
> - Changing `exclude` in `cargo-generate.toml`: update the leftover-placeholder check in `scripts/smoke.sh`.
> - In source templates, never put the package name directly inside macro arguments; bind the call
>   result to a short variable first (rustfmt wraps long argument lists).
> - Comments state what something does, not why it was chosen or how it came about.

## Primary Entry Point: Always Use `just`

```bash
just            # List all available recipes
just check      # Fast compilation check (cargo check)
just test       # Run full test suite (cargo-nextest + doctests)
just lint       # Formatting, TOML, clippy, typos, and doc checks (equivalent to the CI lint job)
just ci         # Full local gate: lint + test + audit (this is what the pre-push hook runs)
```

**Run `just lint` at least once after modifying code.** Do not rely solely on `cargo build`—CI gates on clippy and rustdoc warnings, not just compilation success.

## 5 Critical Gotchas (Do Not Violate)

### 1. Formatting MUST use nightly via `just fmt`

```bash
just fmt        # NEVER run raw `cargo fmt` or `cargo +nightly fmt` directly
```

`rustfmt.toml` relies on **unstable options** (such as `imports_granularity`, `group_imports`, `wrap_comments`). Stable `rustfmt` **silently ignores** them—no error, no formatting—so a local check passes while CI fails.

Do not hardcode `cargo +nightly fmt` either: if `rust-toolchain.toml` pins a dated channel (e.g. `nightly-2026-08-18`), plain `+nightly` resolves to a **different** toolchain that may format differently. `just fmt` derives the exact toolchain from the channel (see `fmt_toolchain` in `justfile`).

### 2. Zero Warnings Policy in CI

CI enforces `-D warnings` for both `cargo clippy` and rustdoc (`RUSTDOCFLAGS="-D warnings"`). Any warning fails the build, including broken intra-doc links, bare URLs, and invalid HTML in doc comments.

### 3. Never Suppress Lints to Bypass CI

When clippy complains, **fix the underlying code**. If suppression is genuinely unavoidable:

```rust
#[expect(clippy::needless_pass_by_value, reason = "required by trait signature")]
```

- Always use `#[expect]`, never `#[allow]`—`clippy::allow_attributes` is a warning, and warnings fail CI. `#[expect]` also flags itself for removal once the lint stops triggering.
- **`reason = "..."` is mandatory.**
- `unsafe_code = "forbid"` is set workspace-wide and cannot be overridden by an attribute. If unsafe code is truly required, ask a human maintainer to downgrade it to `deny`.

{% if toolchain == "stable" %}### 4. Compiler Version is Pinned by `rust-toolchain.toml`

Do not override the toolchain with `rustup override set` or the `RUSTUP_TOOLCHAIN` environment variable. Both take silent precedence over `rust-toolchain.toml`; `just doctor` checks for exactly this.

If the compiler itself crashes (`error: internal compiler error`, leaving `rustc-ice-*.txt`), run `just ice` before changing any code—it reports which compiler build crashed and where.
{% else %}### 4. Nightly Toolchain & Borrow Checker Differences

This project targets nightly, which enables the Polonius borrow checker by default. It accepts more programs than stable NLL, with no warning to mark the difference, so code that builds here may not build on stable.

After changing lifetimes or borrowing logic:

```bash
just nll        # Same nightly toolchain, stable NLL semantics
```

Nightly moves daily; upstream ICEs or new clippy lints can break CI on their own. If an ICE occurs (`rustc-ice-*.txt`), run `just ice` before changing any code.
{% endif %}
{% if crate_type == "bin" %}### 5. Never Use `println!` for Standard Output

Use the `print_line()` helper in `src/main.rs`. `println!` panics when a downstream pipe closes early (e.g. `app | head -n 1`). Diagnostics go to `stderr`, business output goes to `stdout`—never mix them.
{% else %}### 5. Every Public Item Needs a Doc Comment

Library crates set `missing_docs = "warn"`, and CI runs `-D warnings`: a `pub` item without a doc comment fails the build. The crate root needs one too (`//!`)—`missing_crate_level_docs` is enforced as well.
{% endif %}
## Code Organization & Visibility
{% if crate_type == "bin" %}
- **Keep all business logic in `src/lib.rs` and its modules.** `src/main.rs` is reserved for CLI argument parsing, logging initialization, and top-level error handling (<100 lines).
- Code in `main.rs` is unreachable from integration tests (`tests/`), benchmarks, and doctests.{% endif %}
- `pub` is a public contract. Crate-internal utilities must use `pub(crate)` (`unreachable_pub` is enforced).
{% if error_handling %}
## Error Handling Strategy

- **Library side (`src/error.rs`)**: define domain-specific, matchable error enums with `thiserror`.{% if crate_type == "bin" %}
- **Application side (`src/main.rs`)**: use `anyhow::Result` with `.context()` for readable error stacks.{% endif %}
- **Never expose `anyhow::Error` from a public library API**—callers lose the ability to match on specific variants.
- New error variants can be added freely; the enum is `#[non_exhaustive]`.
- Document failure cases of public `Result`-returning functions under an `# Errors` section. This is a house convention, not a CI gate—`missing_errors_doc` is set to `allow`.
{% endif %}{% if async_runtime %}
## Async Rules: Zero Blocking I/O

`clippy.toml` sets `disallowed-types` and `disallowed-methods` against blocking calls such as `std::fs::*` and `std::process::Command`. Use `tokio::fs::*` and `tokio::process::Command` instead.

The ban does not distinguish async from sync context—tests and `build.rs` are caught too. Where synchronous I/O is genuinely required (e.g. reading config before the runtime starts):

```rust
#[expect(clippy::disallowed_methods, reason = "one-time startup config read before runtime launch")]
```
{% endif %}
## Dependency Management

- Declare versions once in the root `Cargo.toml` under `[workspace.dependencies]`; member manifests only write `dep_name = { workspace = true }`. The two tables sit next to each other, and once a version is listed in the first, a bare `cargo add <dep>` writes the inheriting form into the second on its own. Do not pass a version on the command line — `cargo add <dep>@1.2` writes a concrete version instead, even when it matches the catalog entry.
- **Run `just audit` (`cargo-deny`) after touching dependencies.** It checks advisories, licenses, banned crates, and wildcard versions.
- Never edit `Cargo.lock` by hand. CI and Docker builds run with `--locked`.
- Check whether the standard library already covers it before adding a dependency—`[bans.std-replacements]` in `deny.toml` rejects crates that `std` has absorbed (e.g. `lazy_static` vs `std::sync::LazyLock`).

## Testing & Context Control

- Filter tests while debugging to keep output readable:
  ```bash
  cargo nextest run <test_filter>
  ```
- Run `just test` before submitting changes (nextest plus doctests).
- nextest runs each test in its own process, in parallel. For tests sharing a resource (port, database, file), declare a serialization group under `[test-groups]` in `.config/nextest.toml` rather than adding a `Mutex` inside the test code.
- Integration tests (`tests/`) can only reach `pub` APIs.
- `unwrap()`, `expect()`, and `panic!()` are allowed inside tests—`clippy.toml` permits them there.

## Git & Commit Workflow

Run `just hooks` to install the hooks. **Never bypass them with `--no-verify`.**

| Hook | Executed Tasks |
| --- | --- |
| `pre-commit` | Change-scoped fast checks: `rustfmt`, `clippy`, `taplo`, `cargo-deny`, `typos`, private-key detection |
| `commit-msg` | Validates Conventional Commits format |
| `pre-push` | Runs the full `just ci` pipeline |

Commit messages must follow Conventional Commits:

```text
feat(cli): add --json output support
fix: prevent panic when stdout pipe closes early
refactor!: change greet return type to Result      # ! denotes breaking change
```

Allowed types: `build`, `chore`, `ci`, `docs`, `feat`, `fix`, `perf`, `refactor`, `revert`, `style`, `test`.
CHANGELOG entries and `cargo-release` version bumps are derived from these types via `cliff.toml`.

## Prohibited Actions

- Do NOT create unnecessary configuration files.
- Do NOT weaken lints in `Cargo.toml` (`[workspace.lints]`), `clippy.toml`, `rustfmt.toml`, or `deny.toml` to make CI pass.{% if crate_type == "bin" %}
- Do NOT put domain logic in `src/main.rs`.{% endif %}
- Do NOT delete CI jobs to shorten pipeline duration.
- When uncertain, ask instead of guessing or rewriting configuration.
